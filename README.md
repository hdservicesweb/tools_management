# tools_management
Software developed for the management of the different tools of a business
This tool was developed to help control the inputs and outputs of the tools used within an organization.


The origin of the development of this application was required by PSC Electronics, an organization dedicated to the manufacture of wiring for various uses, among which automotive, surgical and tegnological; for which it is exemplified with manual tools.


The tools are part of the organization's assets, so it requires that they be provided and assigned to an employee
as each tool is required, unique IDs were generated for each tool and a label was generated that accompanies each of them 
as well as the box that stores it, each box was assigned a position inside the containers to determine its exact position 
when they are in disuse, calibration date is registered to alert the user about the calibration or maintenance period.


The procedure is simple.
1. An employee who requires a tool approaches the tools administrator or the device responsible for assignments.
2. Look for the necessary tool according to the model or partnumbers that have previously been developed with this tool.
The software shows you the tools found with your search criteria as well as the position and availability of each tool found.
3. the employee selects the required tool
4. Enter your name or employee number. at that time the status of the tool changes to in use until the return of the tool is made.
